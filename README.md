# Portfolio project

## Description

I created this application in order to display the projects I have created in my programming course. It will allow employers to know who I am and also to access my work. I learned how to create a html file as well as how to style them.

## Installation

In order to open the program all you need to do is open the website in the web browser. 

## Usage

To use the program, one can click what section they would like to go to in the top navigation bar. In order access the project, a user just needs to click the image of the projeect they would like to look at.
